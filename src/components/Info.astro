      TodoMVC for Micro Frontends
    </h3>
    <div>
      <p class="mb-5">
        A micro frontends architecture can be built in many ways. Custom crafted and tailored to your organization's specific needs or by following the rules of a specific micro frontends meta-framework. The final result is also affected by the technologies you choose and whether you want to render your application on the server and/or client.

        Making good choices is not always easy. Being able to look at real-world code and examples helps everyone involved to get a good understanding of your decisions and their implications.

        The Tractor Store aims to be to micro frontends what TodoMVC was to the advent of JavaScript Frameworks in the late 2000s: An awesome collection of different implementations for the same application. A valuable learning resource for people new to this topic and also a good basis for advanced discussions.
